# Rainbow-Song

OK a small learning experience

I obvioulsy needed to commit my local changes before they could be pushed to my GitHub Repo. As soon as I did that it worked like a charm. But the stuff I uploade was messy and badly formed so I am editing this nice clean version in the github editor and I will then commit on Github and do a pull from my laptop and I shoudl get this nice type version on my dev computer.

So some file was stashed - I must see where it was indeed stashed and now I do not need it I can then go ahead and delete it so as not to be leaving tons of electronic detritus arround on my laptop

Maybe I just missed a step in Daniel's video - but I am up to speed now and it is starting to make sense. I have learned far more about this guy in a day than all the googling on git and github

I will complete his series as I hope he will show how you can use ones editor with integrated git capabilities to do all the commits and stuff automatically - if that is what you should want.

Trev out.
